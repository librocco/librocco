We need to refactor the supplier-publisher assignment UI in accordance with the update design spec.

The design spec can be found at the following Figma Make link: https://www.figma.com/make/EART7vgFgu96XN2alfWF3N/%E2%98%85-Librocco--Supplier-Config-BRANCH-Split-Assigned-Publishers-List?p=f&t=jvdTi28sEYY78aax-0

Please check the differences between the existing implementation and the design spec and devise the plan to implement the changes.

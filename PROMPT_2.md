The work done is great from functional standpoint, but it mismatches the spec in Figma Make.

Firstly, the Figma make details a different supplier config with 'orders' and 'assignedPublishers' being displayed in different tabs (controlled by buttons at the top).

Please do an additional round of comparison and detail a plan of implementation.

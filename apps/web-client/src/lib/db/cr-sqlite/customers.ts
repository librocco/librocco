/**
 * @fileoverview Customer order management system
 *
 * Customer Orders Overview:
 * - A customer order in the DB is some customer information (email, id, deposit)
 * - Conceptually, customer orders are implicit groupings of order lines, associated with the customer information
 * - Order lines are created in "draft" state and transition through states based on timestamps
 *
 * Order Line States:
 * - Draft: Has created timestamp (inital state)
 * - Placed: Has placed timestamp (order sent to supplier)
 * - Received: Has received timestamp (books arrived from supplier)
 * - Collected: Has collected timestamp (customer picked up books)
 *
 * Data Sources:
 * - customer_order_lines table:
 *   - id: Primary key
 *   - customer_id: References customer
 *   - isbn: Book identifier
 *   - created: Timestamp when line created
 *   - placed: Timestamp when sent to supplier
 *   - received: Timestamp when books arrived
 *   - collected: Timestamp when customer collected
 *
 * Key Implementation Notes:
 * - No explicit "order" concept - just collections of order lines
 * - Book details (title, price etc) come from separate book data source
 * - Status is derived from presence/absence of timestamps

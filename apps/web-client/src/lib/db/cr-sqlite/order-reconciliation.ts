/**
 * @fileoverview Supplier order reconciliation system
 *
 * Reconciliation overview:
 * - The reconciliation process begins when "placed" supplier orders are received
 * - The intention is to compare the isbns and quantities of delivered books against those that were ordered
 * - An employee starts a reconciliation process ("order") by selecting one or more supplier orders
 * - These can be from the same supplier or from different ones => we work with a list of "ordered lines" (`supplier_order_lines`)
 * - At the start of the process, a `reconciliation_order` is created. This tracks the selected `supplier_order` ids, as well as created, updatedAt, & finalized meta
 * - The process involves 3 steps:
 * - - scan/add delivered books
 * - - compare the delivered lines against the ordered
 * - - finalise the process
 * - Delivered lines are managed in a separate table `reconciliation_order_lines`. This is consistent with how supplier and customer order lines are managed.
 * - The comparison needs to check 3 cases:
 * - - "unmatched" isbns - delivered or accidentally scanned books that were never ordered
 * - - over delivered isbns
 * - - under delivered isbns
 * - The finalisation step should
 * - - update the status of the "oldest" customer order line for a given isbn.
 * - - It does not need to do anything with unmatched, or over delivered books. The employee should just be made aware of these anomalies.
 * * - Un- or under delivered isbns should re-enter the working/"possible" order batch for a supplier. Do we need to do anything else here?
 * - It should be possible for multiple people to work on the scan/add step of an in progress reconciliation at the same time
 * - It should not be possible to work on a reconciliation order once it has been finalised.
 *
 * Data Sources:
 * - The `reconciliation_order` table contains meta data about an in progress reconciliation order: related supplier_order ids, created, updatedAt, finalised (boolean)
 * - The `reconciliation_order_lines` table contains the book data lines for a scanned _delivered_ books

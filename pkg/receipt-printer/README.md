# @librocco/receipt-printer

Most of this package is a copy of [node-escpos](https://github.com/song940/node-escpos), refactored to use chorome's usb api (rather than Node apis).

_Note: At this time, this is only supported in Chrome_

_TODO: It would be a good idea to make this compatible with the rest of the `node-escpos` package (and open up a PR), but at this time it's a lot._
